    <h1>img alt tag examples</h1>

    <p>An <code>img</code> tag must have an <code>alt</code> attribute that is an appropriate replacement for the image.</p>
    <p>The examples below demonstrate application of the following helpful ideas for writing alt tags:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "In general, alternative text can be written by considering what one would have written had one not been able to include the image."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "One way to think of alternative text is to think about how you would read the page containing the image to
        someone over the phone, without mentioning that there is an image present. Whatever you say instead of the image
        is typically a good start for writing the alternative text."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Both of these recommendations are from the <a
            href="http://developers.whatwg.org/embedded-content-1.html#general-guidelines" target="_blank">HTML Living
        Standard</a> guidelines for use of alt tags</p>

        <h4>Shooting moving targets indoors</h4>

        <p>The trick here is to know how to anticipate; to know at what speed and
            what distance the subject will pass by.</p>

 photographed quite nicely using this technique.">
